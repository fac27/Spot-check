## Debugging
**Logging elements to the console** can help spot the changes that happen in our code base as it runs and identify a bug.
- ```console.log()``` will print out any value passed to it
- ```console.error()``` will print the value passed to it but styled so as to be more noticeable
- ```console.time()``` and ```console.timeEnd()``` will print out the time elapsed while the code between the two timers ran
- ```console.dir()``` will print an interactive list of the object passed to it

**Introducing Breaks through the development tools** allows us to see a timestamped version of the code as it runs.
This can greatly simplify the task of understanding where along the code base an error has occurred.
i.e.: we can see the value attributed to a variable at the time of the breaker.
